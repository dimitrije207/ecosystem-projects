Kriptomat.io is a VC funded, licensed and fully regulated crypto startup and currently at 300k users around EU.
We provide a platform that is convenient and user friendly for people getting started with crypto.
We provided a price page -  https://kriptomat.io/cryptocurrency-prices/avalanche-avax-price/
A how to buy page - https://kriptomat.io/cryptocurrencies/avalanche/how-to-buy-avalanche/
And an educational guide - https://kriptomat.io/cryptocurrencies/avalanche/what-is-avalanche/
All translated and supported in 23 EU languages. I think we would be a great resource for your EU audience to buy your token.
We are looking for ways how to get in front of your community, for example getting listed on https://ecosystem.avax.network/
We can reciprocate with a link from our Avalanche educational guide, a Twitter post or similar.
